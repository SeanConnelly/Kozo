Kozo is a live edit solution for producing

* Technical Documents
* Data Reports
* Web Pages
* Dashboards

Kozo brings together a number of conventional technologies to produce high quality information solutions at speed. These include:-

* Moustache Template Syntax with dynamic injection of data
* Markdown
* Mermaid
* ChartJS
* D3

Kozo also integrates both client side and server side logic directly into the page. This includes:-

* JavaScript
* ObjectScript
* SQL from the client
* REST

Kozo can be used for many purposes and different levels of experience. Its aim is to lower the technical ceiling for
producing data rich web pages and documents for all levels of developers and data scientists.

A primary driver for Kozo is the automatic production of technical documentation that is baked directly into IRIS projects.
